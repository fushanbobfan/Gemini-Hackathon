Bit of some vibe-coding going on.
I wrote a small concept testing Python program here.
I ran it on my WSL distro on Windows, I can't gurantee this works on Mac.

There's an HTML file here.
Run the app.py with python app.py
Then, locally, open the HTML file through a web browser like Microsoft Edge.
It should hopefully work.
Remember to place your own API key inside.



Michelle: 
When designing front end, macbook users need to turn off AirPlay Receiver settings, can be done in system settings 
To run backend, python app.py
To run frontend, open camera.html 

Made the camera and audio to work tgt, but then need permission to record
